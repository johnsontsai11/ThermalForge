# ThermalForge Roadmap

## Built Features

### Smart Profile (Built)

Proactive thermal curve that monitors temperature velocity and ramps fans before throttling occurs. Targets 85°C ceiling. Works on every machine without calibration.

- Proportional S-curve from 53°C (start) to 85°C (ceiling)
- All profiles share 50°C off threshold, matching Apple's observed behavior
- 6-second sustained trigger filters transient spikes
- Rate-of-change awareness: ramps harder when temp is rising, eases off slowly when falling
- Per-profile ramp governors for acoustic comfort (MAX31760, Microchip AN771)
- 3°C hysteresis (stop at 50°C, start at 53°C)


### Thermal Logging (Built)

Research-grade data export: `thermalforge log`

- CSV with all temperature sensors, fan RPM (actual + target), fan mode per sample
- Process CSV: top 5 processes by CPU at every sample
- JSON metadata: machine, OS, sensor dictionary, session info
- Configurable rate (1-10 Hz), duration, output directory
- Auto-delete after 24h by default, `--no-expire` for researchers

### Safety Systems (Built)

- 95°C safety override: forces max fans regardless of profile
- Per-profile sustained triggers (4-8 seconds) — filters transient spikes
- Heartbeat watchdog: daemon resets fans if app dies (15s timeout)
- Clean state on app launch: fans reset to auto before any profile activates
- Clean shutdown: fans reset on normal app quit
- SMC lock: serializes all fan control operations across daemon threads
- Duplicate instance prevention
- Temperature anomaly detection: instant spikes (>5°C in 2s) and sustained changes (>10°C in 30s) with 30-second rolling process buffer
- Error logging to ~/Library/Logs/ThermalForge/ (daily rotation, 7-day retention)

## Profile Redesign v2 (Complete)

Complete profile system redesign with per-profile curve shapes, ramp rates, sustained triggers, and a dual-cadence 100ms thermal tick. Each profile now has a distinct personality tuned to its purpose. Driven by thermal log analysis showing the previous uniform design failed catastrophically — the sustained trigger prevented Max from engaging fans while temps rocketed from 56°C to 98°C in 6 seconds.

### Research basis

Apple's fan hardware behavior (sources: macos-smc-fan reverse engineering, Tunabelly blog, NMB/Nidec fan motor engineering docs, Analog Devices fan controller datasheets):

- **0 to minimum RPM is binary** — fans jump from off to minimum (2317 RPM on M5 Max, 1200 on M1 Max, 1000 on Mac Studio). No slow start possible — brushless DC motors require a startup burst to overcome static friction. Hardware limitation, not software.
- **Above minimum, smooth ramping** — Apple ramps at ~350-550 RPM/sec up, ~150-300 RPM/sec down. Evaluated every 100ms with small increments.
- **Start/stop cycles are the #1 fan bearing wear factor** — fluid dynamic bearings suffer contact wear during startup (boundary lubrication before hydrodynamic film builds). Minimize on/off cycling.
- **Once spinning, keep spinning** — Apple holds fans at minimum RPM with hysteresis rather than cycling between 0 and spinning. At least 5°C hysteresis between start and stop thresholds.
- **Smoother transitions extend lifespan up to 50%** — per fan engineering literature. Abrupt speed jumps while running cause acoustic and mechanical transients.
- **Ramp-up rate while spinning is NOT a wear factor** — not documented by any fan motor source. Ramp governors are for acoustic comfort only (MAX31760, EMC2301, Microchip AN771).

### Dual-cadence architecture

Thermal polling runs at 200ms for smooth fan transitions (100ms, matching Apple's thermalmonitord, until the tick's SMC reads proved the app's main CPU cost). Heavy operations run at a slower 2-second cadence to avoid overhead:

| Cadence | Interval | Operations |
|---|---|---|
| **Thermal tick** | 200ms | Read temps, calculate curve, apply ramp governor, write fan speed |
| **Monitor tick** | 2 seconds (every 10th tick) | Process capture (sysctl), anomaly detection, temp history for Smart |
| **UI update** | 1 second (every 5th tick) | Push status to SwiftUI menu bar |

### Profile curve design

Each profile has three zones and a per-profile curve shape:

**Zone 1: Off** — below the stop threshold (50°C), fans stay at 0 RPM (Apple auto).
**Zone 2: Minimum hold** — between stop threshold and start threshold (hysteresis band), fans stay at minimum RPM if already running, stay off if already off.
**Zone 3: Proportional curve** — above the start threshold, fan speed scales from minimum RPM to the profile's max using the profile's curve shape.

**Curve shapes:**
- **Ease-in** (pos²): quiet at low temps, ramps harder as heat builds — used by Balanced
- **Linear** (pos): direct proportional response — used by Performance
- **S-curve** (pos²(3-2pos)): smooth at both ends — used by Smart
- **Instant engage**: binary on/off, no proportional curve — used by Max

### Profile specifications

| Profile | Fans off | Start | Ceiling | Max fan | Curve | Trigger | Ramp up | Ramp down |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Silent** | N/A | N/A | N/A | Apple | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Balanced** | 50°C | 55°C | 70°C | 60% | Ease-in | 8s | ~400 RPM/s | ~200 RPM/s |
| **Performance** | 50°C | 55°C | 65°C | 85% | Linear | 4s | ~800 RPM/s | ~300 RPM/s |
| **Max** | 50°C | 65°C | — | 100% | Instant | 5s | Instant | ~200 RPM/s |
| **Smart** | 50°C | 53°C | 85°C | 100% | S-curve | 6s | ~400 RPM/s | ~200 RPM/s |

**Balanced example curve (55-70°C, ease-in, 0-60% of max RPM):**
- 55°C (after 8s sustained): fans jump to minimum RPM (2317)
- 59°C: position 0.27, ease-in 0.07 → fans at ~4% of max RPM
- 62.5°C: position 0.50, ease-in 0.25 → fans at 15% of max RPM (~1172 RPM above min)
- 67°C: position 0.80, ease-in 0.64 → fans at 38% of max RPM
- 70°C: fans at 60% of max RPM (~4696 RPM) — cap reached
- Below 50°C and stable: fans off

The ease-in curve keeps Balanced quiet at low temperatures — at the midpoint, fans are at only 15% instead of the 30% a linear curve would give.

**Max behavior:**
- Below 50°C: fans off
- 50-65°C: hysteresis — fans maintain current state
- 5 seconds sustained above 65°C: **instant jump to 100%** — no ramp governor, no proportional curve
- Temperature drops below 65°C: ramp-down governor at ~200 RPM/s lets temps stabilize
- Below 50°C and rate-of-change ≤ 0: fans off

**Silent (Apple Default)** is purely hands-off: ThermalForge monitors temperatures but Apple controls the fans entirely.

### Smart curve

Smart uses the same three-zone model with an S-curve shape and:
- Rate-of-change awareness: if temp is rising, boost fan speed proportionally to the rate and proximity to 85°C ceiling
- Conservative S-curve as default (no calibration required)
- 6-second sustained trigger — proactive but filtered
- Future: calibration data and runtime learning can refine the curve (see Planned Features)
- Temperature anomaly logging with process capture (>10°C in 30s)

## Planned Features

### Calibration (Research Tool)

Machine-specific thermal calibration for the Smart profile. Currently available as a CLI-only research command (`sudo thermalforge calibrate`). The stress infrastructure (Metal compute + CPU stress with adaptive intensity) is built and functional — it can spike CPU and GPU load to measure thermal response.

The calibration methodology needs further research to produce data that meaningfully improves Smart's default curve. The fan control industry does not typically pre-calibrate — they use proportional curves with runtime adaptation, which is what Smart already does.

Future direction: runtime learning during normal use, where Smart observes the relationship between fan speed and temperature response during real workloads and refines its curve over time.

### Runtime Learning

During normal use, Smart observes how the machine responds to fan speed changes. Over time, it learns machine-specific thermal characteristics without any stress test. This produces better data than synthetic calibration because it reflects real workloads.

### Enhanced Logging

Additional data points for research-grade logging:

- **Thermal throttle state** — `ProcessInfo.thermalState` (nominal/fair/serious/critical) and `com.apple.system.thermalpressurelevel` (5 levels). Captured at every sample.
- **Power draw** — SMC power keys (PSTR, PCPT, PCPG) for package and per-domain wattage.
- **GPU utilization** — Metal performance statistics or IOKit GPU activity.
- **Memory pressure** — system memory pressure percentage.
- **Delta-T over ambient** — temperatures as both absolute °C and delta above ambient. Standard comparison metric (Gamers Nexus, Notebookcheck, Jarrod's Tech).
- **User markers** — `thermalforge mark "started render"` inserts annotated timestamp into active session.
- **Statistical summary** — min, max, mean, std dev, P95, P99 for all sensors. Time in each thermal state. Peak fan RPM.
